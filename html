        <h2>1. Agriculture</h2>
        <p>
            Shyamora is a city located on the banks of the Himalayas next to Dehradun. The region 
            benefits from the fertile Doon Valley soil and an abundance of water resources. Here, we can 
            focus on crops like basmati rice, wheat, and seasonal fruits. The cultivable land consists of both
            flat land and land in mountains, basically terrace farming. Considering the potential growth, 
            we are thinking of implementing the following:
        </p>
        <h3>Potential Growth:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sustainable farming: Going green, and adopting organic farming to reduce environmental degradation.</li>
            <li>Technology integration: Using technology to predict weather, quality of soil, etc.</li>
            <li>Vertical farming: Efficient land use in urban areas.</li>
            <li>Agriculture hubs: Processing, packaging, and exporting produce.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>SDG Goals:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Target 2.1:</strong> By 2030, end hunger and ensure all people, particularly the poor and vulnerable, have access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food year-round.</li>
            <li><strong>Target 2.3:</strong> By 2030, double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers, especially women, indigenous people, family farmers, and fishers.</li>
            <li><strong>Target 2.4:</strong> Ensure sustainable food production systems and resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity while adapting to climate change and disasters.</li>
            <li><strong>Target 12.3:</strong> By 2030, halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Industrial Area Development</h2>
        <p>
            The industrial area of Shyamora primarily constitutes IT, pharmaceuticals, and education-related 
            sectors. We also have a dam where we have placed solar panels. Currently, we need to tackle pollution. 
            Considering the potential growth:
        </p>
        <h3>Potential Growth:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Green industrial zones: Promoting eco-friendly industrial hubs focusing on renewable energy and clean manufacturing.</li>
            <li>Agro-processing industries: Promoting local industries as much as possible, such as achar making and Pahadi namak.</li>
            <li>Skill development centres: Establish training hubs for youth in IT, renewable energy, and biotech sectors, leveraging proximity to Shyamora's educational institutions.</li>
            <li>Cottage and handicraft industries: Preserve cultural heritage through traditional crafts and handlooms.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>SDG Goals:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Target 8.2:</strong> Achieve higher levels of economic productivity through diversification, technological upgrading, and innovation.</li>
            <li><strong>Target 8.4:</strong> Improve global resource efficiency in consumption and production and decouple economic growth from environmental degradation.</li>
            <li><strong>Target 9.4:</strong> Enhance scientific research and upgrade the technological capabilities of industrial sectors.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            1. Create an industrial park with 100% eco-friendly practices by 2030.<br>
            2. Generate 50,000 new jobs in manufacturing, logistics, and IT sectors.<br>
            3. Establish export-focused units for handicrafts and sustainable products.

        <h2>3. Water Supply Network</h2>
        <p>
            Shyamora is a city located on the banks of the Yamuna River, so the entire city is dependent
            on it. As urbanization continues to increase, it is very important to have proper water
            management. For that, we are introducing smart water management, promoting rainwater harvesting, and creating
            areas for groundwater recharge. We also want to ensure that each household, each farmer, and each industrial
            area receives water evenly.
        </p>
       
        <h3>SDG Goals:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Target 6.1:</strong> Universal access to safe drinking water by 2030.</li>
            <li><strong>Target 6.4:</strong> By 2030, substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable freshwater supplies.</li>
            <li><strong>Target 6.6:</strong> Protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including rivers, lakes, and aquifers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Risk Prediction and Management</h2>
        <p>
            Located in a seismically active region, Shyamora faces risks of earthquakes, floods, and landslides. 
            Proactive measures are being taken to mitigate these risks.
        </p>
        <h3>Potential Growth:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>AI-powered risk models: Early warning systems using geospatial data.</li>
            <li>Emergency infrastructure: Shelters, hospitals, and supply storage in disaster-prone areas.</li>
            <li>Community preparedness: Regular disaster management drills for residents.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>SDG Goals:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Target 11.5:</strong> Significantly reduce the number of people affected by disasters, focusing on economic and environmental impacts.</li>
            <li><strong>Target 13.1:</strong> Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            1. Train 70% of the population in disaster risk management by 2028.<br>
            2. Develop a real-time disaster prediction system using AI by 2030.<br>
            3. Strengthen 100% of critical infrastructure (hospitals, schools, etc.) to withstand natural disasters.
